I wrote this in what was basically a 1 am brainstorming mad scramble so it's not very polished but I'm gonna move it over from Notion so that other people can access it, please fix whatever mess I have created there's bound to be a bunch of plot holes I swear

The monster has the ability to manipulate time and objects’ places in time.

You are a prisoner who was found guilty for attempted murder - it was a revenge killing for <insert macguffin relative> and you never had the chance to finish the job. You have returned to the location of your original crime by pure chance, or maybe some organizational manager’s idea of a cruel joke.

When the agents arrive, they are trapped in the forest and in the following day, you are able to discover the presence of the entity. It loops the day before the backup arrive so that you can figure out how to free it from its time loop. In exchange, you will be sent back in time so that you can finish the job and let the older version of you take the fall while you get to escape and live out the rest of the life you originally wanted.

The way time travel works in this universe is time turner like, so future events still happen its just like cloning yourself in the past sort of.

However, the actual, original version of events is that when the agents went into the forest the first day, they found <insert macguffin procedure such as ritual sacrifice that rewuires expendable d-class> and brought everyone along the second day. They only took really long the first day because they were investigating and recording the information. On the second day’s afternoon, the D-class are taken out to the place but in the disorganization of the proceedings, they are able to revolt and overpower the scientists and agents while a portion have left and are busy reporting back to the foundation with the unexpected effects of the ritual or whatever.

The entity offers the D-class their goals in exchange for freedom since it has the power to warp time for trades that it has been officially summoned (we need a reason to explain why the foundation was so reckless). The agents and scientists return (team B if you will) and subdue (read: probably just kill) most D-class, and you escape in the chaos. Before it can go after you to make a deal (since obviously foundation staff wouldn’t intentionally free a keter level risk) a scientist is able to use the time loop against them, and the actually 3rd day loops itself. 

The monster can only rewind people for the time they have been in its sphere of influence. It could rewind the agents and scientists back to their original positions and make them release it again, but now that it has been partially released it would do nothing. However, it can rewind the townsfolk to whichever state it wishes to. Maybe this means that the promises it made to the other D-class were lies, but it does have the power to restore you to the fateful day of your failed avenging.

In the end, there is a choice to make. It could be good to go with 3 endings, or kind of 2:

1. if you do everything right, you should be able to seal the monster again, the byproduct being neutralizing the time loop everyone is imprisoned in. You are given a partial pardon?
2. If you don’t, you have two options. You can either not help the entity, which means that you, the agents, and the entity will be trapped forever, sparing humanity from the dangers of its release; or you can take a gamble and make the deal, jumping back to enjoy your lifetime or so of peace before the time-manipulating entity becomes too much for even the foundation to control.

Now I just have to plot the intricacies of how the monster came to be, how to convey the extent of its powers, and how we and the foundation know how to release, seal, and completely free it. (Also a lot of other stuff obviously)
