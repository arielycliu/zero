This is the first portion of the game where the MC will enter the loop.

Help me edit this - just change anything that isn't good, I can't plot for the life of me.

---GENERAL PLOT---

MC is on a van being transported with a handful of other D-class personnel to a remote location. They have been driving for quite a long time - mountain ranges and stretches of fields have passed by in the rear window. The actual destination is unknown but they can see that the procession of cars passes through a forest a bit before arriving. Everyone is settling into their new temporary location on the outskirts of the town/village/city.

The foundation has received news of a potentially memetic anomaly in this town and are sending a small team of scientists and agents to scope the area out with D-class as the lab rats. The previous team of agents that was sent here never got back. The team is to gauge the containment risk and perform some basic readings before reporting back to the foundation so that they. If the foundation does not hear anything from them within the next two days, it will assume an extremely high level of risk and sweep/evacuate the entire area.

The reports describe unexplainable objects appearing in town (and most often in the surrounding natural areas), inconsistent behaviour from the townsfolk, and disappearances. The scientists branch out for interviews, observations, and testing, taking the agents and most of the D-class with them. The rest of the D-class lodge in a hastily repurposed motel. 

Around 3 o'clock, a D-class escapes while being escorted and runs off while security is relatively low. The rest of the agents follow, leaving one security guard behind to watch the prisoners. Soon, they fall asleep in the office of the makeshift jail, and you are able to break out. 

The MC meets the antiques collector who will serve as a trader. Depending on the actions taken when escaping the room, they will greet the collector either as a guard or an intern. The dialogue is the same regardless of outcome. You learn a bit about her life in the town, and tell her some information about yourself. She likes any trinkets that are unique or rare. 

Afterwards, you can explore the town a bit. Nothing really happens in this first day. You can buy 

---GAMEPLAY---

The actual introduction/exposition isn't interactive. Think of it like a text cutscene.

You are able to interact starting when the guards leave and you have to break out of your room. I'm not sure if we can keep up this level of detail. We shall see. 

In the room are:
- a desk (will serve as permanent item storage for permanent items? or just set dressing)
- a simple oak chair
- a small, barred window
- an ornate cross on a small mount that can be disassembled to get a strip of metal and some wire
- a bed with no blankets
- a door, locked from the outside

A neighbouring bathroom has:
- a porcelain sink (working) 
- a dry and dirty toilet
- a bar of soap - if you examine or use it, there is a bird-shaped ring inside that can be traded away

In order to escape the room, you can pry the cross off the wall and break it apart. The strip of metal will act as a shim to unlock your handcuffs, and the wires can be inserted into the door as a lockpick. Everything else is set dressing since this is your room that you will come back to for sleeping and stuff. 

After you get out, the guard's office is on your left. It's just a receptionist's office, repurposed for - sleeping, apparently. 
- a uniform can be taken and put on
- a pen sits on the table
- the guard can be examined
- the guard's wallet is in their pocket and can be stolen

If you take the uniform and use it on yourself, you can pass as a guard to the collector.
